# RoadMap
This roadmap outlines the list of algorithms and functions that will be added to the repository. Each algorithm/function is listed with a checkbox to track its progress. When contributing, make sure to check the relevant box for the function you are working on, or add it to the list (if not present, create one) if it is missing.
